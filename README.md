# UMLParser


UML Parser to parse existing Java Code into UML class diagrams

Using Javaparser APIs to parse Java code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).


Further once this AST string is generated, then we will pass this as an argument to YUML RESTful API.

The program will also generate Sequence Diagram for the Java source code.

The functionality will eventually be deployed to Cloud and made available as service.
